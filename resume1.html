   <h3> Qualification 1</h3>
      <p>It is important to take care of the patient, to be followed 
       by the doctor, but it is a time of great pain and suffering. 
       For to come to the smallest detail, no one should practice any 
       kind of work unless he derives some benefit from it. Do not be 
       angry with the pain in the reprimand in the pleasure he wants 
       to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no breeding. 
       Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come out; they are 
       in fault who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is toil.</p>
